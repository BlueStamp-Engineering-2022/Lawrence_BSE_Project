# Custom Audio Synthesizer
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting a up a functional circuit with 1 button and multiple potentiometers. In order to accomplish this, I had to find a new program that was compatible with my arduino model and make many edits so it could support multiple potentiometers, since the program provided in the project instructions was outdated. I learned how to program with the arduino programming language, how to execute functions in MIDI(Musicanl Instrument Digital Interface), and how to create a circuit with jumper wires and a breadboard. Making the necessary edits to the code was certainly challenging, as the original code performed a control change function whenever it detected a change from any analog pin, instead of designating specific commands for each analog pin. It was fun testing out the verious MIDI controls and producing my first sound, though.

# Starter Project
My starter project was Simon Says. In order to complete this project, I learned soldering as well as the functions of each part to ensure that I constructed it correctly. For example, I needed to know that LEDs had positive and negative polarity in order to place them accordingly. Soldering the components, especially the microcontroller, was somewhat challenging considering it was my first day. However, it was definitely satisfying to do the final assembly and see the project finally come together.
