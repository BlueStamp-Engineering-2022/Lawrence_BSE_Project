# Custom Audio Synthesizer
This device utilizes buttons and potentiometers to send digital and analog inputs to an arduino. The arduino is programmed to convert these inputs into MIDI(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) signals. Your computer is then able to interpret these signals using your favorite audio software.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milsetone was finishing the hardware portion of my project, which consisted of constructing the box and wiring all the components to a breadboard. To accomplish this, I had to learn how to use a handheld drill and a file in order to create all the necessary holes in the box. Afterwards, I soldered wires to all the buttons and potentiometers and then secured them onto the box. I really enjoyed this process, as it was the first time I had worked on hardware after only working on software for 2 weeks. However, the next step of wiring all the components to the breadboard and fitting everyhting inside the box was quite challenging.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting a up a functional circuit with 1 button and multiple potentiometers. In order to accomplish this, I had to find a new program that was compatible with my arduino model and make many edits so it could support multiple potentiometers, since the program provided in the project instructions was outdated. I learned how to program with the arduino programming language, how to execute functions in MIDI(Musicanl Instrument Digital Interface), and how to create a circuit with jumper wires and a breadboard. Making the necessary edits to the code was certainly challenging, as the original code performed a control change function whenever it detected a change from any analog pin, instead of designating specific commands for each analog pin. It was fun testing out the verious MIDI controls and producing my first sound, though.

# Starter Project
My starter project was Simon Says. In order to complete this project, I learned soldering as well as the functions of each part to ensure that I constructed it correctly. For example, I needed to know that LEDs had positive and negative polarity in order to place them accordingly. Soldering the components, especially the microcontroller, was somewhat challenging considering it was my first day. However, it was definitely satisfying to do the final assembly and see the project finally come together.
